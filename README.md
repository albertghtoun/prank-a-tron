Road Test Auto Scheduler (RTAS)
===========

This project aims at automatically scheduling road test for anyone who may concern. 

Currently RTAS can only be used in PA. 

#How to use#

RTAS is a chrome extension that can be installed very easily. Just click Settings->Extensions, check the "Developer mode" checkbox and use the "Load unpacked extension..." dialog to allow chrome use this extension. Don't forget to enable the extension and refresh the scheduling page https://www.dot33.state.pa.us/exam_scheduling/eslogin.jsp

After you log into the PA road test scheduling system, choose the test center you want to take the exam and hit continue, if you fail to continue due to no available exams, RTAS would help you continue to schedule until eventually succeed. RTAS will notify you through an audio clip. So you won't miss it!

This is just a prototype, and more features would be available soon.
